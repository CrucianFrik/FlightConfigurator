AHRS_GPS_GAIN,This controls how much to use the GPS to correct the attitude. This should never be set to zero for a plane as it would result in the plane losing control in turns. For a plane please use the default value of 1.0.,
AHRS_GPS_MINSATS,"Minimum number of satellites visible to use GPS for velocity based corrections attitude correction. This defaults to 6, which is about the point at which the velocity numbers from a GPS become too unreliable for accurate correction of the accelerometers.",
AHRS_GPS_USE,"This controls whether to use dead-reckoning or GPS based navigation. If set to 0 then the GPS won't be used for navigation, and only dead reckoning will be used. A value of zero should never be used for normal flight. Currently this affects only the DCM-based AHRS: the EKF uses GPS whenever it is available.","0:Disabled,1:Enabled"

ARMING_OPTIONS,Bitmask of mission items that are required to be planned in order to arm the aircraft,
ARMING_REQUIRE,"Arming disabled until some requirements are met. If 0, there are no requirements (arm immediately).  If 1, require rudder stick or GCS arming before arming motors and sends the minimum throttle PWM value to the throttle channel when disarmed.  If 2, require rudder stick or GCS arming and send 0 PWM to throttle channel when disarmed. See the ARMING_CHECK_* parameters to see what checks are done before arming. Note, if setting this parameter to 0 a reboot is required to arm the plane.  Also note, even with this parameter at 0, if ARMING_CHECK parameter is not also zero the plane may fail to arm throttle at boot due to a pre-arm check failure.","0:Disabled,1:THR_MIN PWM when disarmed,2:0 PWM when disarmed"

EK3_MAG_CAL,"This determines when the filter will use the 3-axis magnetometer fusion model that estimates both earth and body fixed magnetic field states and when it will use a simpler magnetic heading fusion model that does not use magnetic field states. The 3-axis magnetometer fusion is only suitable for use when the external magnetic field environment is stable. EK3_MAG_CAL = 0 uses heading fusion on ground, 3-axis fusion in-flight, and is the default setting for Plane users. EK3_MAG_CAL = 1 uses 3-axis fusion only when manoeuvring. EK3_MAG_CAL = 2 uses heading fusion at all times, is recommended if the external magnetic field is varying and is the default for rovers. EK3_MAG_CAL = 3 uses heading fusion on the ground and 3-axis fusion after the first in-air field and yaw reset has completed, and is the default for copters. EK3_MAG_CAL = 4 uses 3-axis fusion at all times. EK3_MAG_CAL = 5 uses an external yaw sensor with simple heading fusion. NOTE : Use of simple heading magnetometer fusion makes vehicle compass calibration and alignment errors harder for the EKF to detect which reduces the sensitivity of the Copter EKF failsafe algorithm. NOTE: The fusion mode can be forced to 2 for specific EKF cores using the EK3_MAG_MASK parameter. EK3_MAG_CAL = 6 uses an external yaw sensor with fallback to compass when the external sensor is not available if we are flying. NOTE: The fusion mode can be forced to 2 for specific EKF cores using the EK3_MAG_MASK parameter. NOTE: limited operation without a magnetometer or any other yaw sensor is possible by setting all COMPASS_USE, COMPASS_USE2, COMPASS_USE3, etc parameters to 0 and setting COMPASS_ENABLE to 0. If this is done, the EK3_GSF_RUN and EK3_GSF_USE masks must be set to the same as EK3_IMU_MASK. A yaw angle derived from IMU and GPS velocity data using a Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF) will then be used to align the yaw when flight commences and there is sufficient movement.",

EK3_OGN_HGT_MASK,"When a height sensor other than GPS is used as the primary height source by the EKF, the position of the zero height datum is defined by that sensor and its frame of reference. If a GPS height measurement is also available, then the height of the WGS-84 height datum used by the EKF can be corrected so that the height returned by the getLLH() function is compensated for primary height sensor drift and change in datum over time. The first two bit positions control when the height datum will be corrected. Correction is performed using a Bayes filter and only operates when GPS quality permits.

LAND_ABORT_DEG,"This parameter is used when using a rangefinder during landing for altitude correction from baro drift (RNGFND_LANDING=1) and the altitude correction indicates your actual altitude is higher than the intended slope path. Normally it would pitch down steeply but that can result in a crash with high airspeed so this allows remembering the baro offset and self-abort the landing and come around for another landing with the correct baro offset applied for a perfect slope. An auto-abort go-around will only happen once, next attempt will not auto-abort again. This operation happens entirely automatically in AUTO mode. This value is the delta degrees threshold to trigger the go-around compared to the original slope.

MIXING_GAIN,"The gain for the Vtail and elevon output mixers. The default is 0.5, which ensures that the mixer doesn't saturate, allowing both input channels to go to extremes while retaining control over the output. Hardware mixers often have a 1.0 gain, which gives more servo throw, but can saturate. If you don't have enough throw on your servos with VTAIL_OUTPUT or ELEVON_OUTPUT enabled then you can raise the gain using MIXING_GAIN. The mixer allows outputs in the range 900 to 2100 microseconds.",
MIXING_OFFSET,"The offset for the Vtail and elevon output mixers, as a percentage. This can be used in combination with MIXING_GAIN to configure how the control surfaces respond to input. The response to aileron or elevator input can be increased by setting this parameter to a positive or negative value. A common usage is to enter a positive value to increase the aileron response of the elevons of a flying wing. The default value of zero will leave the aileron-input response equal to the elevator-input response.",

NAVL1_PERIOD,"Period in seconds of L1 tracking loop. This parameter is the primary control for agressiveness of turns in auto mode. This needs to be larger for less responsive airframes. The default of 20 is quite conservative, but for most RC aircraft will lead to reasonable flight. For smaller more agile aircraft a value closer to 15 is appropriate, or even as low as 10 for some very agile aircraft. When tuning, change this value in small increments, as a value that is much too small (say 5 or 10 below the right value) can lead to very radical turns, and a risk of stalling.",

OVERRIDE_CHAN,"If set to a non-zero value then this is an RC input channel number to use for giving IO manual control in case the main FMU microcontroller on a board with a IO co-processor fails. When this RC input channel goes above 1750 the FMU microcontroller will no longer be involved in controlling the servos and instead the IO microcontroller will directly control the servos. Note that IO manual control will be automatically activated if the FMU crashes for any reason. This parameter allows you to test for correct manual behaviour without actually crashing the FMU. This parameter is can be set to a non-zero value either for ground testing purposes or for giving the effect of an external override control board. Please also see the docs on OVERRIDE_SAFETY. Note that you may set OVERRIDE_CHAN to the same channel as FLTMODE_CH to get IO based override when in flight mode 6. Note that when override is triggered due to a FMU crash the 6 auxiliary output channels on Pixhawk will no longer be updated, so all the flight controls you need must be assigned to the first 8 channels.",

STALL_PREVENTION,"Enables roll limits at low airspeed in roll limiting flight modes. Roll limits based on aerodynamic load factor in turns and scale on ARSPD_FBW_MIN that must be set correctly.

STAT_RUNTIME,Total time autopilot has run,
STEER2SRV_D,This adjusts the damping of the steering control loop. This gain helps to reduce steering jitter with vibration. It should be increased in 0.01 increments as too high a value can lead to a high frequency steering oscillation that could overstress the vehicle.,
STEER2SRV_DRTFCT,"Degrees of steering wheel to derate at each additional m/s of speed above ""Derating speed"". Should be set so that at higher speeds the plane does not roll to the wing in turns.",
STEER2SRV_DRTMIN,"The angle that limits smallest angle of steering wheel at maximum speed. Even if it should derate below, it will stop derating at this angle.",
STEER2SRV_DRTSPD,Speed after that the maximum degree of steering will start to derate. Set this speed to a maximum speed that a plane can do controlled turn at maximum angle of steering wheel without rolling to wing. If 0 then no derating is used.,
STEER2SRV_FF,The feed forward gain for steering this is the ratio of the achieved turn rate to applied steering. A value of 1 means that the vehicle would yaw at a rate of 45 degrees per second with full steering deflection at 1m/s ground speed.,
STEER2SRV_I,This is the gain from the integral of steering angle. Increasing this gain causes the controller to trim out steady offsets due to an out of trim vehicle.,
STEER2SRV_IMAX,"This limits the number of degrees of steering in centi-degrees over which the integrator will operate. At the default setting of 1500 centi-degrees, the integrator will be limited to +- 15 degrees of servo travel. The maximum servo deflection is +- 45 centi-degrees, so the default value represents a 1/3rd of the total control throw which is adequate unless the vehicle is severely out of trim.",
STEER2SRV_MINSPD,"This is the minimum assumed ground speed in meters/second for steering. Having a minimum speed prevents oscillations when the vehicle first starts moving. The vehicle can still drive slower than this limit, but the steering calculations will be done based on this minimum speed.",
STEER2SRV_P,The proportional gain for steering. This should be approximately equal to the diameter of the turning circle of the vehicle at low speed and maximum steering angle,
STEER2SRV_TCONST,"This controls the time constant in seconds from demanded to achieved steering angle. A value of 0.75 is a good default and will work with nearly all rovers. Ground steering in aircraft needs a bit smaller time constant, and a value of 0.5 is recommended for best ground handling in fixed wing aircraft. A value of 0.75 means that the controller will try to correct any deviation between the desired and actual steering angle in 0.75 seconds. Advanced users may want to reduce this time to obtain a faster response but there is no point setting a time less than the vehicle can achieve.",
STICK_MIXING,"When enabled, this adds user stick input to the control surfaces in auto modes, allowing the user to have some degree of flight control without changing modes.  There are two types of stick mixing available. If you set STICK_MIXING to 1 then it will use ""fly by wire"" mixing, which controls the roll and pitch in the same way that the FBWA mode does. This is the safest option if you usually fly ArduPlane in FBWA or FBWB mode. If you set STICK_MIXING to 2 then it will enable direct mixing mode, which is what the STABILIZE mode uses. That will allow for much more extreme maneuvers while in AUTO mode. If you set STICK_MIXING to 3 then it will apply to the yaw while in quadplane modes only, such as while doing an automatic VTOL takeoff or landing.",

TECS_APPR_SMAX,"The sink rate max for the landing approach stage of landing. This will need to be large for steep landing approaches especially when using reverse thrust. If 0, then use TECS_SINK_MAX.",
TECS_CLMB_MAX,Maximum demanded climb rate. Do not set higher than the climb speed at THR_MAX at TRIM_ARSPD_CM when the battery is at low voltage. Reduce value if airspeed cannot be maintained on ascent. Increase value if throttle does not increase significantly to ascend.,
TECS_HGT_OMEGA,This is the cross-over frequency of the complementary filter used to fuse vertical acceleration and baro alt to obtain an estimate of height rate and height.,
TECS_INTEG_GAIN,Integrator gain to trim out long-term speed and height errors.,
TECS_LAND_ARSPD,"When performing an autonomus landing, this value is used as the goal airspeed during approach.  Note that this parameter is not useful if your platform does not have an airspeed sensor (use TECS_LAND_THR instead).  If negative then this value is not used during landing.",
TECS_LAND_DAMP,This is the sink rate gain for the pitch demand loop when in final landing stage of flight. It should be larger than TECS_PTCH_DAMP to allow for better sink rate control during flare.,
TECS_LAND_IGAIN,This is the integrator gain on the control loop during landing. When set to 0 then TECS_INTEG_GAIN is used. Increase to increase the rate at which speed and height offsets are trimmed out. Typically values lower than TECS_INTEG_GAIN work best,
TECS_LAND_PDAMP,This is the damping gain for the pitch demand loop during landing. Increase to add damping  to correct for oscillations in speed and height. If set to 0 then TECS_PTCH_DAMP will be used instead.,
TECS_LAND_PMAX,This limits the pitch used during the final stage of automatic landing. During the final landing stage most planes need to keep their pitch small to avoid stalling. A maximum of 10 degrees is usually good. A value of zero means to use the normal pitch limits.,
TECS_LAND_SINK,The sink rate in meters/second for the final stage of landing.,
TECS_LAND_SPDWGT,"Same as SPDWEIGHT parameter, with the exception that this parameter is applied during landing flight stages.  A value closer to 2 will result in the plane ignoring height error during landing and our experience has been that the plane will therefore keep the nose up -- sometimes good for a glider landing (with the side effect that you will likely glide a ways past the landing point).  A value closer to 0 results in the plane ignoring speed error -- use caution when lowering the value below 1 -- ignoring speed could result in a stall. Values between 0 and 2 are valid values for a fixed landing weight. When using -1 the weight will be scaled during the landing. At the start of the landing approach it starts with TECS_SPDWEIGHT and scales down to 0 by the time you reach the land point. Example: Halfway down the landing approach you'll effectively have a weight of TECS_SPDWEIGHT/2.","Same as SPDWEIGHT parameter, with the exception that this parameter is applied during landing flight stages.

TECS_LAND_SRC,"When zero, the flare sink rate (TECS_LAND_SINK) is a fixed sink demand. With this enabled the flare sinkrate will increase/decrease the flare sink demand as you get further beyond the LAND waypoint. Has no effect before the waypoint. This value is added to TECS_LAND_SINK proportional to distance traveled after wp. With an increasing sink rate you can still land in a given distance if you're traveling too fast and cruise passed the land point. A positive value will force the plane to land sooner proportional to distance passed land point. A negative number will tell the plane to slowly climb allowing for a pitched-up stall landing. Recommend 0.2 as initial value.",
TECS_LAND_TCONST,This is the time constant of the TECS control algorithm when in final landing stage of flight. It should be smaller than TECS_TIME_CONST to allow for faster flare,
TECS_LAND_TDAMP,This is the damping gain for the throttle demand loop during and auto-landing. Same as TECS_THR_DAMP but only in effect during an auto-land. Increase to add damping to correct for oscillations in speed and height. When set to 0 landing throttle damp is controlled by TECS_THR_DAMP.,
TECS_LAND_THR,This is the sink rate gain for the pitch demand loop when in final landing stage of flight. It should be larger than TECS_PTCH_DAMP to allow for better sink rate control during flare.,"Same as SPDWEIGHT parameter, with the exception that this parameter is applied during landing flight stages.  A value closer to 2 will result in the plane ignoring height error during landing and our experience has been that the plane will therefore keep the nose up -- sometimes good for a glider landing (with the side effect that you will likely glide a ways past the landing point).  A value closer to 0 results in the plane ignoring speed error -- use caution when lowering the value below 1 -- ignoring speed could result in a stall. Values between 0 and 2 are valid values for a fixed landing weight. When using -1 the weight will be scaled during the landing. At the start of the landing approach it starts with TECS_SPDWEIGHT and scales down to 0 by the time you reach the land point. Example: Halfway down the landing approach you'll effectively have a weight of TECS_SPDWEIGHT/2."
TECS_OPTIONS,This allows the enabling of special features in the speed/height controller,
TECS_PITCH_MAX,"Overrides LIM_PITCH_MAX in automatic throttle modes to reduce climb rates. Uses LIM_PITCH_MAX if set to 0. For proper TECS tuning, set to the angle that the aircraft can climb at TRIM_ARSPD_CM and THR_MAX.",
TECS_PITCH_MIN,"Overrides LIM_PITCH_MIN in automatic throttle modes to reduce descent rates. Uses LIM_PITCH_MIN if set to 0. For proper TECS tuning, set to the angle that the aircraft can descend at without overspeeding.",
TECS_PTCH_DAMP,This is the integrator gain on the control loop during landing. When set to 0 then TECS_INTEG_GAIN is used. Increase to increase the rate at which speed and height offsets are trimmed out. Typically values lower than TECS_INTEG_GAIN work best,
TECS_PTCH_FF_K,This parameter sets the gain between demanded airspeed and pitch. It has units of radians per metre per second and should generally be negative. A good starting value is -0.04 for gliders and -0.08 for draggy airframes. The default (0.0) disables this feed-forward.,
TECS_PTCH_FF_V0,This parameter sets the airspeed at which no feed-forward is applied between demanded airspeed and pitch. It should correspond to the airspeed in metres per second at which the plane glides at neutral pitch including STAB_PITCH_DOWN.,
TECS_RLL2THR,"Gain from bank angle to throttle to compensate for loss of airspeed from drag in turns. Set to approximately 10x the sink rate in m/s caused by a 45-degree turn. High efficiency models may need less while less efficient aircraft may need more. Should be tuned in an automatic mission with waypoints and turns greater than 90 degrees. Tune with PTCH2SV_RLL and KFF_RDDRMIX to achieve constant airspeed, constant altitude turns.",
TECS_SINK_MAX,Maximum demanded climb rate. Do not set higher than the climb speed at THR_MAX at TRIM_ARSPD_CM when the battery is at low voltage. Reduce value if airspeed cannot be maintained on ascent. Increase value if throttle does not increase significantly to ascend.,"Same as SPDWEIGHT parameter, with the exception that this parameter is applied during landing flight stages.  A value closer to 2 will result in the plane ignoring height error during landing and our experience has been that the plane will therefore keep the nose up -- sometimes good for a glider landing (with the side effect that you will likely glide a ways past the landing point).

TECS_SINK_MIN,Minimum sink rate when at THR_MIN and TRIM_ARSPD_CM.,
TECS_SPDWEIGHT,"When zero, the flare sink rate (TECS_LAND_SINK) is a fixed sink demand. With this enabled the flare sinkrate will increase/decrease the flare sink demand as you get further beyond the LAND waypoint. Has no effect before the waypoint. This value is added to TECS_LAND_SINK proportional to distance traveled after wp. With an increasing sink rate you can still land in a given distance if you're traveling too fast and cruise passed the land point. A positive value will force the plane to land sooner proportional to distance passed land point. A negative number will tell the plane to slowly climb allowing for a pitched-up stall landing. Recommend 0.2 as initial value.",
TECS_SPD_OMEGA,This is the cross-over frequency of the complementary filter used to fuse longitudinal acceleration and airspeed to obtain a lower noise and lag estimate of airspeed.,
TECS_SYNAIRSPEED,"This enable the use of synthetic airspeed for aircraft that don't have a real airspeed sensor. This is useful for development testing where the user is aware of the considerable limitations of the synthetic airspeed system, such as very poor estimates when a wind estimate is not accurate. Do not enable this option unless you fully understand the limitations of a synthetic airspeed estimate.","0:Disable,1:Enable"
TECS_THR_DAMP,Use this parameter instead of LAND_ARSPD if your platform does not have an airspeed sensor.  It is the cruise throttle during landing approach.  If this value is negative then it is disabled and TECS_LAND_ARSPD is used instead.,"0:Disable,1:Enable"
TECS_TIME_CONST,This is the damping gain for the throttle demand loop during and auto-landing. Same as TECS_THR_DAMP but only in effect during an auto-land.

TECS_TKOFF_IGAIN,This is the integrator gain on the control loop during takeoff. When set to 0 then TECS_INTEG_GAIN is used. Increase to increase the rate at which speed and height offsets are trimmed out. Typically values higher than TECS_INTEG_GAIN work best,
TECS_VERT_ACC,Maximum vertical acceleration used to correct speed or height errors.,
TELEM_DELAY,The amount of time (in seconds) to delay radio telemetry to prevent an Xbee bricking on power up,
TERRAIN_ENABLE,"enable terrain data. This enables the vehicle storing a database of terrain data on the SD card. The terrain data is requested from the ground station as needed, and stored for later use on the SD card. To be useful the ground station must support TERRAIN_REQUEST messages and have access to a terrain database, such as the SRTM database.","0:Disable,1:Enable"
TERRAIN_FOLLOW,"This enables terrain following for RTL and LAND flight modes. To use this option TERRAIN_ENABLE must be 1 and the GCS must  support sending terrain data to the aircraft.  In RTL the RTL_ALT will be considered a height above the terrain.  In LAND mode the vehicle will slow to LAND_SPEED 10m above terrain (instead of 10m above home).  This parameter does not affect AUTO and Guided which use a per-command flag to determine if the height is above-home, absolute or above-terrain.","0:Do Not Use in RTL and Land,1:Use in RTL and Land"
TERRAIN_LOOKAHD,"This controls how far ahead the terrain following code looks to ensure it stays above upcoming terrain. A value of zero means no lookahead, so the controller will track only the terrain directly below the aircraft. The lookahead will never extend beyond the next waypoint when in AUTO mode.",
TERRAIN_MARGIN,"This controls how far ahead the terrain following code looks to ensure it stays above upcoming terrain. A value of zero means no lookahead, so the controller will track only the terrain directly below the aircraft. The lookahead will never extend beyond the next waypoint when in AUTO mode.",
TERRAIN_OFS_MAX,"This controls how far ahead the terrain following code looks to ensure it stays above upcoming terrain. A value of zero means no lookahead, so the controller will track only the terrain directly below the aircraft. The lookahead will never extend beyond the next waypoint when in AUTO mode.",
TERRAIN_OPTIONS,Options to change behaviour of terrain system,
TERRAIN_SPACING,"Distance between terrain grid points in meters. This controls the horizontal resolution of the terrain data that is stored on te SD card and requested from the ground station. If your GCS is using the ArduPilot SRTM database like Mission Planner or MAVProxy, then a resolution of 100 meters is appropriate. Grid spacings lower than 100 meters waste SD card space if the GCS cannot provide that resolution. The grid spacing also controls how much data is kept in memory during flight. A larger grid spacing will allow for a larger amount of data in memory. A grid spacing of 100 meters results in the vehicle keeping 12 grid squares in memory with each grid square having a size of 2.7 kilometers by 3.2 kilometers. Any additional grid squares are stored on the SD once they are fetched from the GCS and will be loaded as needed.",
THROTTLE_NUDGE,"When enabled, this uses the throttle input in auto-throttle modes to 'nudge' the throttle or airspeed to higher or lower values. When you have an airspeed sensor the nudge affects the target airspeed, so that throttle inputs above 50% will increase the target airspeed from TRIM_ARSPD_CM up to a maximum of ARSPD_FBW_MAX. When no airspeed sensor is enabled the throttle nudge will push up the target throttle for throttle inputs above 50%.","0:Disabled,1:Enabled"
THR_FAILSAFE,"This enables failsafe on loss of RC input. How this is detected depends on the type of RC receiver being used. For older radios an input below the THR_FS_VALUE is used to trigger failsafe. For newer radios the failsafe trigger is part of the protocol between the autopilot and receiver. A value of 2 means that the RC input won't be used when throttle goes below the THR_FS_VALUE, but it won't trigger a failsafe","0:Disabled,1:Enabled,2:EnabledNoFailsafe"

THR_PASS_STAB,"Minimum throttle percentage used in all modes except manual, provided THR_PASS_STAB is not set. Negative values allow reverse thrust if hardware supports it.",
THR_SLEWRATE,Specifies the auto-landing type to use,"0:Standard Glide Slope, 1:Deepstall"
THR_SUPP_MAN,"When throttle is suppressed in auto mode it is normally forced to zero. If you enable this option, then while suppressed it will be manual throttle. This is useful on petrol engines to hold the idle throttle manually while waiting for takeoff","0:Disabled,1:Enabled"
TKOFF_ACCEL_CNT,"This is the number of acceleration events to require for arming with TKOFF_THR_MINACC. The default is 1, which means a single forward acceleration above TKOFF_THR_MINACC will arm. By setting this higher than 1 you can require more forward/backward movements to arm.",
TKOFF_ALT,Altitude that altitude control modes will climb to when a takeoff is triggered with the throttle stick.,
TKOFF_DIST,This is the distance from the takeoff location where the plane will loiter. The loiter point will be in the direction of takeoff (the direction the plane is facing when the motor starts),
TKOFF_FLAP_PCNT,The amount of flaps (as a percentage) to apply in automatic takeoff,
TKOFF_LVL_ALT,This is the altitude below which wings are held level for TAKEOFF mode,
TKOFF_LVL_PITCH,This is the target pitch for the initial climb to TKOFF_LVL_ALT,
TKOFF_PLIM_SEC,"This parameter reduces the pitch minimum limit of an auto-takeoff just a few seconds before it reaches the target altitude. This reduces overshoot by allowing the flight controller to start leveling off a few seconds before reaching the target height. When set to zero, the mission pitch min is enforced all the way to and through the target altitude, otherwise the pitch min slowly reduces to zero in the final segment. This is the pitch_min, not the demand. The flight controller should still be commanding to gain altitude to finish the takeoff but with this param it is not forcing it higher than it wants to be.",
TKOFF_ROTATE_SPD,"This parameter sets the airspeed at which the aircraft will ""rotate"", setting climb pitch specified in the mission. If TKOFF_ROTATE_SPD is zero then the climb pitch will be used as soon as takeoff is started. For hand launch and catapult launches a TKOFF_ROTATE_SPD of zero should be set. For all ground launches TKOFF_ROTATE_SPD should be set above the stall speed, usually by about 10 to 30 percent",
TKOFF_TDRAG_ELEV,"This sets the rate in m/s at which FBWB and CRUISE modes will change its target altitude for full elevator deflection. Note that the actual climb rate of the aircraft can be lower than this, depending on your airspeed and throttle control settings. If you have this parameter set to the default value of 2.0, then holding the elevator at maximum deflection for 10 seconds would change the target altitude by 20 meters.","0:Disabled,1:Enabled"
TKOFF_TDRAG_SPD1,"This sets the rate in m/s at which FBWB and CRUISE modes will change its target altitude for full elevator deflection. Note that the actual climb rate of the aircraft can be lower than this, depending on your airspeed and throttle control settings. If you have this parameter set to the default value of 2.0, then holding the elevator at maximum deflection for 10 seconds would change the target altitude by 20 meters.","0:Disabled,1:Enabled"
TKOFF_THR_DELAY,This parameter sets the time delay (in 1/10ths of a second) that the ground speed check is delayed after the forward acceleration check controlled by TKOFF_THR_MINACC has passed. For hand launches with pusher propellers it is essential that this is set to a value of no less than 2 (0.2 seconds) to ensure that the aircraft is safely clear of the throwers arm before the motor can start. For bungee launches a larger value can be used (such as 30) to give time for the bungee to release from the aircraft before the motor is started.,

TKOFF_THR_MINACC,This is the target altitude for TAKEOFF mode,
TKOFF_THR_MINSPD,"Minimum GPS ground speed in m/s used by the speed check that un-suppresses throttle in auto-takeoff. This can be be used for catapult launches where you want the motor to engage only after the plane leaves the catapult, but it is preferable to use the TKOFF_THR_MINACC and TKOFF_THR_DELAY parameters for catapult launches due to the errors associated with GPS measurements. For hand launches with a pusher prop it is strongly advised that this parameter be set to a value no less than 4 m/s to provide additional protection against premature motor start. Note that the GPS velocity will lag the real velocity by about 0.5 seconds. The ground speed check is delayed by the TKOFF_THR_DELAY parameter.",
TKOFF_THR_SLEW,"This parameter sets the slew rate for the throttle during auto takeoff. When this is zero the THR_SLEWRATE parameter is used during takeoff. For rolling takeoffs it can be a good idea to set a lower slewrate for takeoff to give a slower acceleration which can improve ground steering control. The value is a percentage throttle change per second, so a value of 20 means to advance the throttle over 5 seconds on takeoff. Values below 20 are not recommended as they may cause the plane to try to climb out with too little throttle. A value of -1 means no limit on slew rate in takeoff.","This parameter sets the slew rate for the throttle during auto takeoff. When this is zero the THR_SLEWRATE parameter is used during takeoff.

TKOFF_TIMEOUT,This is the timeout for an automatic takeoff. If this is non-zero and the aircraft does not reach a ground speed of at least 4 m/s within this number of seconds then the takeoff is aborted and the vehicle disarmed. If the value is zero then no timeout applies.,
TRIM_ARSPD_CM,This is the cross-over frequency of the complementary filter used to fuse vertical acceleration and baro alt to obtain an estimate of height rate and height.,"Same as SPDWEIGHT parameter, with the exception that this parameter is applied during landing flight stages.

TRIM_PITCH_CD,Offset applied to AHRS pitch used for in-flight pitch trimming. Correct ground leveling is better than changing this parameter.,
TRIM_THROTTLE,"Enables roll limits at low airspeed in roll limiting flight modes. Roll limits based on aerodynamic load factor in turns and scale on ARSPD_FBW_MIN that must be set correctly. Without airspeed sensor, uses synthetic airspeed from wind speed estimate that may both be inaccurate.","0:Disabled,1:Enabled"

TUNE_MODE_REVERT,This controls whether tuning values will revert on a flight mode change.,"0:Disable,1:Enable"
TUNE_PARAM,This sets which parameter or set of parameters will be tuned. Values greater than 100 indicate a set of parameters rather than a single parameter.

TUNE_RANGE,This sets the range over which tuning will change a parameter. A value of 2 means the tuning parameter will go from 0.5 times the start value to 2x the start value over the range of the tuning channel,
TUNE_SELECTOR,"This sets the channel for the transmitter tuning selector switch. This should be a 2 position switch, preferably spring loaded. A PWM above 1700 means high, below 1300 means low.

USE_REV_THRUST,"This controls when to use reverse thrust. If set to zero then reverse thrust is never used. If set to a non-zero value then the bits correspond to flight stages where reverse thrust may be used. Note that reverse thrust is only ever auto-enabled in auto-throttle modes. In modes where throttle control is pilot controlled the ability to do reverse thrust is controlled by throttle stick input. The most commonly used value for USE_REV_THRUST is 2, which means AUTO_LAND only. That enables reverse thrust in the landing stage of AUTO mode. Another common choice is 1, which means to use reverse thrust in all auto flight stages.",
